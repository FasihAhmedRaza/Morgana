      <p className=" text-gray-300">
        Morgana and you agree to attempt to resolve any dispute arising out of
        or relating to these Terms or your use of the Website through good faith
        negotiation. If the parties are unable to resolve a dispute within
        fifteen (15) calendar days of written notice of the dispute, the dispute
        shall then be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the
        following procedures:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-300">
        <li className=" text-gray-300">
          Mediation. Before resorting to arbitration, the parties agree to
          participate in a mediation conducted by a mutually agreeable neutral
          mediator in accordance with the rules of a reputable mediation service
          provider, such as the American Arbitration Association (AAA). The cost
          of the mediation shall be shared equally by the parties.
        </li>
        <li>
          Binding Arbitration. If the dispute is not resolved through mediation,
          or the parties elect not to participate in mediation, it shall be
          decided by binding arbitration. This arbitration will be governed by
          the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") with regard to procedural matters.
          However, the substantive law of the State of Texas, without regard to
          its conflict of law provisions, will apply to the underlying dispute.
          The arbitration shall be conducted in Dallas, Texas, by a single
          arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Rules of the American
          Arbitration Association ("AAA"). The decision of the arbitrator shall
          be final and binding on the parties hereto and may be enforced in any
          court of competent jurisdiction. You and Morgana agree that any
          arbitration under these Terms shall be conducted on an individual
          basis and not in a class action proceeding.

        <li>
          YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF,
          OR RELATING TO, THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE.
