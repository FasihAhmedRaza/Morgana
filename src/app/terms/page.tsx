        Morgana and you agree to attempt to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Website through good faith negotiation. If the parties are unable to resolve a dispute within fifteen (15) calendar days of written notice of the dispute, the dispute shall then be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the following procedures:

      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-300">
        <li className=' text-gray-300'>
          Mediation. Before resorting to arbitration, the parties agree to participate in a mediation conducted by a mutually agreeable neutral mediator in accordance with the rules of a reputable mediation service provider, such as the American Arbitration Association (AAA). The cost of the mediation shall be shared equally by the parties.
        </li>
        <li>
          Binding Arbitration. If the dispute is not resolved through mediation, or the parties elect not to participate in mediation, it shall be decided by binding arbitration. This arbitration will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") with regard to procedural matters. However, the substantive law of the State of Texas, without regard to its conflict of law provisions, will apply to the underlying dispute. The arbitration shall be conducted in Dallas, Texas, by a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and Morgana agree that any arbitration under these Terms shall be conducted on an individual basis and not in a class action proceeding.
